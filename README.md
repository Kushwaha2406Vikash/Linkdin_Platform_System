# LinkedIn Platform Simulation (Java Console Application)

Welcome to **LinkedIn Platform Simulation**, a Java-based console application that mimics the core features of LinkedIn, the world's leading professional networking platform. This project is built to demonstrate fundamental **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java by simulating real-world interactions such as networking, messaging, job recruitment, and profile management.

---

## 📌 Overview

This simulation models a simplified professional networking platform where users can:

- Create and manage profiles
- Connect with other professionals
- Share skills and endorsements
- Apply for jobs
- Send messages
- Receive notifications

It’s designed as a learning project to help grasp essential programming principles such as **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **abstraction**, and **polymorphism**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **User & Company Creation**  
  Create individual users and companies with unique identities.
  
- ✅ **Login Simulation**  
  Simulate login sessions for users with basic authentication flow.
  
- ✅ **Profile Management**  
  Add skills, write recommendations, and set up professional profiles.
  
- ✅ **Skill Endorsement**  
  Users can endorse each other’s skills to build credibility.
  
- ✅ **Connection Requests**  
  Send and accept connection requests between users.
  
- ✅ **Direct Messaging**  
  Send and delete messages between connected users.
  
- ✅ **Job Postings & Applications**  
  Companies can post jobs and users can apply using a resume link.
  
- ✅ **Real-Time Notifications**  
  Notify users about connection requests, messages, job updates, and more.
